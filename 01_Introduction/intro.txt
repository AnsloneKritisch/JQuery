So how do we get jQuery? We have two options:

1> Link a CDN hosted file (like we did for bootstrap)
2> Download the .js file from jQuery’s official website

Once you’ve connected the jQuery using the <script> tags in your HTML,
then you can the specialized jQuery calls, to interact with the DOM.

Let’s see a few examples of how jQuery differs from “vanilla” javascript.

// jQuery
var divs = $('div');

// Vanilla
var divs = document.querySelectorAll('div');

/ jQuery
$(el).css('border-width', '20px');

// Vanilla
el.style.borderWidth = '20px';

As you can see some situations are helped tremendously by jQuery while others may not necessitate it.

Due to its massive popularity, it is still very important to understand it, because you will run it to a lot in the real world!
